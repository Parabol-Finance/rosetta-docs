Rosetta’s Smart Yield Router is a fully non-custodial orchestration layer that routes user capital to the highest-performing vaults across HyperEVM. It continuously monitors vault performance on a block-by-block basis and reallocates dynamically to maintain optimal yield efficiency while preserving capital integrity.

Unlike traditional optimizers, Rosetta does not tokenize deposits or custody assets. The router operates entirely through on-chain policies, orchestrating user-owned wallets and vaults without ever touching deposited funds.

## Onboarding

Users onboard by connecting their primary wallet (Metamask, Rabby, etc.). Upon connection, Rosetta automatically generates a **sub-account** (an on-chain wallet) linked to the user’s main address.

This sub-account acts as the operational layer for all vault interactions — deposits, withdrawals, and reallocations — but remains fully controlled by the user’s primary wallet. The assets residing in the sub-account can only be withdrawn to the users primary wallet, protected by the policies, ensuring funds security.
