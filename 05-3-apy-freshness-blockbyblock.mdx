# 3 APY & freshness (block‑by‑block)

- **APY (live)** reads from the **latest processed block**; no manual refresh.
- **Latest Block** displays the block height/time used.
- Charts glide during quiet periods and step on parameter/tx changes.
- When the chain briefly reorders blocks, we recalculate those blocks and refresh the reads.
