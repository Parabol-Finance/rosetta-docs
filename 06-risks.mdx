- No Leverage or Liquidation Exposure: All allocations are delta-neutral. The worst-case scenario is yield decay to zero — not capital loss.
- Smart Contract Independence: The router itself holds no funds and executes logic purely via policies.
- Vault-Level Isolation: Each vault operates independently; failure in one cannot affect another.

- Private Keys: Users Private Key cannot be exported by only the wallet owner.
