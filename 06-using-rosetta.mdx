## Connecting Your Wallet

To start using Rosetta:

1. Navigate to [app.rosetta.sh](https://app.rosetta.sh/)

3. Select your wallet provider
4. Approve the connection

After first connection, Rosetta will deploy a smart account (sub-account) linked to your wallet, following your signature. This is a one-time setup.

## Understanding Your Accounts

After connecting, you have two accounts:

| Account | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Connected Wallet | Your main wallet (EOA). Holds your keys. Receives withdrawals. |
| Sub-account | Smart account that holds routed funds. Controlled by your main wallet. |

Both addresses are visible in the Account section. Funds deposited into Rosetta are held in your sub-account, not by Rosetta.
