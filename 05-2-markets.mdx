A lending market is an isolated pool where lenders supply assets and borrowers take loans against collateral.

Each market is defined by five parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Collateral asset | Asset borrowers lock (e.g., HYPE, ETH, BTC) |
| Loan asset | Asset lenders supply and borrowers receive (e.g., USDC, USDT0) |
| LLTV | Liquidation Loan-to-Value, threshold at which positions become liquidatable |
| Oracle | Price feed used to value collateral |
| IRM | Interest Rate Model, determines rates based on utilization |

**Utilization**

Utilization is the ratio of borrowed assets to total supplied assets:

`Utilization = Total Borrowed / Total Supplied`

`Supply APY = Borrow APY × Utilization`

Utilization drives rates. Higher utilization means higher rates. Lower utilization means lower rates.

**Liquidity**

`Available liquidity = Total Supplied - Total Borrowed`

This is what's actually can be borrowed at any moment. When utilization is high, available liquidity is low.

**Price Per Share (PPS)**
Lenders receive shares representing their claim on the pool. As interest accrues, total assets grow while shares stay constant. The ratio (assets/shares) increases over time. This is how yield is realized without explicit payments.

**Isolation**

Markets are isolated. A WHYPE/USDC market and a kHYPE/USDC market share nothing: different collateral, different risk parameters, different utilization. Bad debt in one market does not affect others.
