## Fields

| Field | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **Collateral assets** | Eligible collateral and **LLTV** |
| **Loans** | Borrowable asset(s) |
| **Borrow APY (live)** | Borrow rate per block |
| **Liquidity** | Borrowable capacity |
| **Utilization** | % of capacity in use |
| **LLTV** | Max borrow against collateral |
| **Latest Block** | Freshness stamp |

## Workflow

1. Read **Borrow APY (live)** line — look for **hold vs. spike** →
2. Check **Liquidity** ≥ your intended size (watch caps/queues) →
3. Check **Utilization** band — avoid extremes if sizing; note sensitivity →
4. Validate **LLTV** headroom on your collateral (leave a buffer) →
5. If pairing with a supply leg, confirm **net spread after fees/impact** ≥ 0 →
6. **Borrow**
