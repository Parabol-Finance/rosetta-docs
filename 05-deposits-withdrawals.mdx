When a user initiates a deposit, funds are transferred directly from their **main wallet** into their **Rosetta sub-account** — a dedicated wallet fully controlled by the user’s primary address. 

To participate in any Rosetta allocator, users must hold the corresponding asset in their **main wallet**. For example, if the user wants to maximize their earnings in **HYPE**, the user must first have HYPE tokens available in their main account. Then deposit them into their sub-account. So basically, the “deposit” in Rosetta refers to transferring your funds from your main account, to your sub-account. 

Once the deposit is completed and the execution confirmed, Rosetta’s allocation engine takes over autonomously, managing the distribution and rebalancing of funds among the selected vaults according to system policies and performance metrics.

Withdrawals follow the same non-custodial principle. When a user requests a withdrawal, funds are transferred **only** from the sub-account back to the **main wallet**. Any other withdrawal destination is strictly prohibited by design, ensuring that user assets can never be redirected elsewhere
