### Deposits

1. Transfer assets from main wallet to smart account
2. Router allocates to optimal vault based on current yields

Allocation is immediate. The Router selects the highest-yielding vault from the user's enabled set, accounting for margin impact.

### Withdrawals

1. Request withdrawal
2. Router exits vault position
3. Assets return to main wallet

Withdrawals can only go to the user's main wallet. This is enforced at the contract level.
