# Overview

Rosetta reads Hyperliquid markets and vaults **every block**, distilling complex on-chain data into a clean, actionable user interface: **live APY, deposits, utilization, liquidity, LLTV,** and **latest block** — giving you the complete picture at a glance.

Most dashboards only refresh when transactions occur; Rosetta updates **every block** — giving you the true current state, not just stale snapshots from the last trade.

**Use Rosetta to:**

- See which vault or market is best to lend and borrow right-now.
- Avoid entering on fading spikes.
- Allocate with confidence. You’re acting on the *truest* live data.
