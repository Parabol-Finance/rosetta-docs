## Introduction

### What is Rosetta

Rosetta is yield infrastructure for Hyperliquid, built to make on-chain yield transparent and actionable.

It consists of two core components:

**Indexer**: A block-level data infrastructure that tracks lending markets, vaults, and yields continuously. Computes state every block for accurate APY reporting, utilization tracking, and liquidity monitoring.

**Yield Router**: A non-custodial allocation system that routes capital across vaults based on real-time yield data, user-defined policies, and cost-aware, lightning fast execution logic. 

The Indexer provides the data layer. The Yield Router consumes that data to make allocation decisions and execute them through user-controlled smart accounts. Together, they form infrastructure that applications (including the Router itself) are built on.

### Principles

**Non-custodial**: Users operate through smart accounts (sub-accounts) that they control. Rosetta orchestrates deposits and rebalances within these accounts, but withdrawals can only be sent to the user's main wallet. Funds never sit in Rosetta's custody.

**Block-level precision**: Interest accrues every block. The Indexer reflects this by computing vault and market states at block cadence, enabling accurate yield comparisons and APY reporting.

**User-controlled policies**: Users define which vaults and assets the Router can access. These policies are stored on-chain and enforced programmatically. Changing them requires the user's signature. 

**Transparent by default**: Every yield figure, allocation decision, and rebalancing action is derived from on-chain data and verifiable. Users see where returns come from, not just what they are.

**Fully automated**: Once policies are set, the Router handles allocation and rebalancing without manual intervention. Users define the rules; Rosetta executes within them.

**Sponsored execution**: Rosetta covers all gas costs for deposits, withdrawals, and rebalancing. The APY users see is the APY they earn. No hidden transaction costs eating into returns.
