## Overview

Rosetta is the block‑level yield router for Hyperliquid (HyperCore × HyperEVM). We index funding and carry flows across vaults and markets, price execution risk in real time, and route stablecoin capital to the best risk‑adjusted yield — non‑custodially, API‑first.

Rosetta reads Hyperliquid markets and vaults **every block**, distilling complex on-chain data into a clean, actionable user interface: **live APY, deposits, utilization, liquidity, LLTV,** and **latest block** — giving you the complete picture at a glance.
Most lending markets only refresh when transactions occur; Rosetta updates **every block** — giving you the true current state, not just stale snapshots from the last trade.


Use Rosetta to:
  1. See which vault or market is best to lend and borrow right-now.
  2. Avoid entering on fading spikes.
  3. Allocate with confidence. You’re acting on the **_truest_** live data.

## Why Rosetta
We recompute **APY every block** and stamp each view with **Latest Block** so you know what’s current and what’s not.

|               | Event-only systems        | **Rosetta**                                       |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| APY freshness | Updates on transactions only | **Updates every block** (even in quiet periods)   |
| Quiet periods | Flat line, then sudden jump  | **Smooth glide** that reflects implied rate drift |
| Trust signal  | No explicit timebase         | **Latest Block** visible on every tile/detail     |
| Comparability | Screens can be out of sync   | **Single clock** across vaults/markets            |
| Actionability | You react after the snap     | You act on **what’s true now**                    |

**Quick example:**

- `13:02:00` — Event‑based UI shows 12.8%.
- `13:02:15` — Utilization softens (no tx); model implies 11.9%.
- `13:02:20` — Rosetta already shows 11.9%.
- `13:02:40` — First tx lands; event‑based UI finally updates to 11.9%.

**Result**: 20–40s of better information—often enough to avoid a bad entry.
