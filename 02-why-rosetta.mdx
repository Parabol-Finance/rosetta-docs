# Why Rosetta

**The problem**: Event-only dashboards freeze between transactions. APY can fluctuate for seconds/minutes without being visible.

**Rosetta’s answer:** We recompute **APY every block** and stamp each view with **Latest Block** so you know what’s current and what’s not. 

|  | Event-only dashboards | **Rosetta** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **APY freshness** | Updates on transactions only | **Updates every block** (even in quiet periods) |
| **Quiet periods** | Flat line, then sudden jump | **Smooth glide** that reflects implied rate drift |
| **Trust signal** | No explicit timebase | **Latest Block** visible on every tile/detail |
| **Comparability** | Screens can be out of sync | **Single clock** across vaults/markets |
| **Actionability** | You react after the snap | You act on **what’s true now** |

**Quick example:**

- `13:02:00 — Event‑based UI shows **12.8%**.`
- `13:02:15 — Utilization softens (no tx); model implies **11.9%**.`
- `13:02:20 — **Rosetta already shows 11.9%**.`
- `13:02:40 — First tx lands; event‑based UI finally updates to **11.9%**.`

**Result**: 20–40s of better information—often enough to avoid a bad entry.
