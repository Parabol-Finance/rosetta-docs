# Terms of Service

**Terms of Service**\
Last Updated: 27/11/2025\
Legal Entity: Parabol Labs Ltd., United Kingdom

## Introduction

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Rosetta, a non-custodial yield routing platform operating on Hyperliquid (HyperCore × HyperEVM) ("Rosetta", "we", "us", "our"). By connecting your wallet or interacting with Rosetta in any way, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms of Service.

If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use Rosetta.

## Nature of the Service (Technical Infrastructure Only)

Rosetta is software infrastructure, not a financial product or service which:

- Deploys and interacts with on-chain smart contracts that you authorize.
- Generates a user-owned sub-account linked to your EOA.
- Routes assets only between vaults you select.
- Executes rule-based, policy-driven instructions that you configure.
- Evaluates vault and market data to enable automated execution under your policies.
- Never holds, takes custody of, or exercises unilateral control over user assets.
- Never initiates transactions without your on-chain authorization.
- Does not issue tokens or perform portfolio management.

You acknowledge that Rosetta is middleware, not a custodian, broker, asset manager, exchange, adviser, or fiduciary.

All actions are executed from your sub-wallet (sub-account), under policies you authorize.

## User-Owned Sub-Accounts

When you authorize the creation of a sub-account:

### Ownership

The sub-account is entirely owned and controlled by you.

- Rosetta cannot export, access, or retrieve your private keys.
- Rosetta cannot withdraw, redirect, or repurpose your assets.
- All funds in the sub-account remain non-custodial at all times.

### Withdrawals

Withdrawals always:

- Retrieve funds from underlying vault allocations you selected
- Return them only to your EOA

### Execution Authority

By using Rosetta:

- You authorize Rosetta to execute policy-based transactions from your sub-account.
- Rosetta may move funds only between vaults you have selected.
- Rosetta cannot transfer your assets to any arbitrary or unauthorized address.
- Your private keys remain solely your responsibility.

## Eligibility & Access

To use Rosetta, you confirm that:

- You are legally permitted to interact with decentralized smart-contract systems in your jurisdiction.
- You are not a prohibited, sanctioned, or restricted person under applicable laws.
- You use Rosetta only for lawful purposes.

Rosetta may restrict or block access to comply with legal obligations.

## User Responsibilities

You agree to:

- Use Rosetta only as permitted by these Terms.
- Maintain control and security of your wallet private keys
- Ensure you have sufficient asset balances before initiating deposits
- Avoid exploiting, reverse-engineering, or interfering with Rosetta systems
- Understand that all on-chain activity is final and irreversible.
- Select the vaults or protocols you want Rosetta to route between.
- Not interfere with, exploit, reverse-engineer, attack, or abuse the Service or its smart contracts.

All transactions originating from your wallet or sub-account are deemed authorized by you.

## Deposits, Withdrawals, and Allocation Logic

### Deposits

Depositing means:

- Transferring supported assets (e.g HyperEVM-native tokens)
- From your EOA
- Into your sub-account

This deposit is not a transfer to Rosetta. Rosetta never holds user assets.

### Allocation

Once funds are in your sub-account:

- Your authorized policies determine when and how funds move.
- Movements occur only within vaults you have selected.
- Rebalancing is policy-based and non-custodial.
- All movements are executed through smart-contract logic you have authorized

### Withdrawals

At your request:

- Funds are retrieved directly from underlying vaults
- Returned only to your EOA

Smart contract rules may require waiting periods or settlement steps depending on vault logic

## No Financial, Investment, or Legal Advice

Rosetta provides automation and technical execution tools only.

Nothing displayed by Rosetta—including APYs, block-level metrics, performance charts, routing options, vault data, or configuration tools—constitutes:

- Investment or financial advice
- A recommendation
- A fiduciary duty
- Portfolio management
- An assessment of suitability or appropriateness
- Legal or tax advice

Rosetta does not guarantee yields, returns, or performance. You make all decisions independently.

## Non-Custodial Model; No Control Over Assets

Rosetta does not:

- Hold or store user assets
- Possess private keys
- Execute withdrawals
- Transfer assets to unapproved destinations
- Act with discretionary or unilateral authority
- Guarantee performance, APY, or outcomes

All actions occur on-chain through contracts you authorize. Some jurisdictions may interpret policy-based execution as limited operational control. You acknowledge and accept this risk.

## Fees

Rosetta charges fees based on internal routing and execution policies.

- Fees are taken automatically through on-chain execution
- Fees may apply to transactions or operations performed on your sub-account
- The exact fee model may evolve based on system design
- All fees are transparently enforced by smart contract logic

## Third-Party Protocols & Risks

Rosetta integrates with independent third-party vaults and protocols.

Parabol Labs Ltd. does not control or guarantee:

- Vault performance
- Smart contract security
- Collateral models
- Pricing data or APY
- HyperEVM chain stability
- Execution or liquidity behavior
- Oracle behavior
- Market conditions

By using Rosetta, you accept risks inherent to on-chain systems, including:

- Smart contract vulnerabilities
- Market volatility
- Execution delays
- Liquidity constraints
- Underlying protocol failures
- Network congestion
- Oracle failures
- Data propagation issues
- Blockchain outages

Your interactions with third-party protocols are entirely at your own risk.

## Disclaimer of Warranties

Rosetta is provided "as-is" and "as-available", without warranties of any kind, including:

- Uninterrupted availability
- Accurate or up-to-date data
- Error-free execution
- Exploit-free smart contracts
- On-chain or off-chain performance
- Future yields or results

You use Rosetta entirely at your own risk.

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

Parabol Labs Ltd. is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential losses, including:

- Loss of digital assets
- Loss of yield, opportunity, or performance
- Rebalancing delays or failures
- Smart contract vulnerabilities
- Protocol failures
- Network congestion
- Blockchain outages
- Data inaccuracies
- Wallet compromise
- Actions taken based on displayed metrics

## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Parabol Labs Ltd. from all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses arising from:

- Your use or misuse of Rosetta
- Actions executed from your wallet or sub-account
- Breach of these Terms
- Violations of applicable laws
- Interactions with third-party protocols
- Unauthorized access resulting from compromised private keys

## Data & Privacy

Rosetta may process limited technical data (e.g., logs, device information, wallet address, IP metadata) necessary to operate the Service. Parabol Labs Ltd. does not store private keys or sensitive financial data. Use of Rosetta constitutes acceptance of the Rosetta Privacy Policy, which explains data collection and GDPR rights.

## Modifications & Termination

Parabol Labs Ltd. may modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of Rosetta at any time. Material changes will be posted on the website or interface. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of updated Terms. You may stop using Rosetta at any time; your on-chain assets remain fully under your control.

## Governing Law & Jurisdiction

These Terms are governed by the laws of England & Wales. The courts of London have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from or relating to these Terms.

## Entire Agreement

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Parabol Labs Ltd. regarding your use of Rosetta.
