# Who it’s for

**A) Self‑directed users**

- **Need:** Fast, clean reads to place/adjust positions without guesswork.
- **How they use it:** Open **Markets/Vaults**, check **leader**, glance **utilization/liquidity**, execute.
- **Outcome:** Confident entries/exits on the **currently highest APY**, sized to depth and risk.

**B) Trading Desks / Curators / Props / Small funds**

- **Need:** Reliable truth layer in the workflow.
- **How they use it:** Pin **Markets** as the yield clock. Watch rotations on block‑level curves. Time reallocations.
- **Outcome:** Single source of truth; cleaner coordination and entry timing.

> **Coming Soon:** Automated, non‑custodial smart reallocation that follows Rosetta’s live signals to keep capital in the best options, maximize the returns.
